# RailsAdmin custom_action stock_report  

Consider you have a need to manage products that belong to certain categories.  
In this exercise, you create a Product model and a Cateogry model, and then decide to use RailsAdmin.  
Now you need stock reports for products and for categories.  

Oh, what do do?  

A custom action sounds like a good solution, doesn't in?  
If you've answered yes, take a peak at this app's code. :-)
